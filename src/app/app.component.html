  <em>By Aristotle</em>
  <p [fontResizer]="40">
    Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common name, 
    the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. Thus, a real man and a 
    figure in a picture can both lay claim to the name 'animal'; yet these are equivocally so named, 
    for, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. 
    For should any one define in what sense each is an animal, his definition in the one case will be 
    appropriate to that case only. 
  </p>
  <p fontResizer>On the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally' which have both the name and the definition answering to the name in common. A man and an ox are both 'animal', and these are univocally so named, inasmuch as not only the name, but also the definition, is the same in both cases: for 
      if a man should state in what sense each is an animal, the statement in the one case would be identical 
      with that in the other. </p>
  <p fontResizer>Forms of speech are either simple or composite. Examples of the latter are such expressions as 'the man runs', 
    'the man wins'; of the former 'man', 'ox', 'runs', 'wins'. </p>
