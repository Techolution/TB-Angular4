    <h1>Angular 4 Reactive Forms Lab</h1>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>You should already have the Angular 4 solutions repo checked out. 
        Checkout the following branch but DO NOT look at the code!
    </p>
    <p><code>git checkout forms-reactive</code></p>
    <p>

    <ol>
        <li>Start your server if it is not already running and navigate to http://localhost:4200/</li>
        <li>Create your own Reactive form that works like this one. It does not have to have the same styling but should
            have the following functionality:
            <ul>
                <li>Should display a list of users that can be selected.</li>
                <li>The user data model should be: id:number, name: string, nickName: string, sex:string, optIn: boolean;</li>
                <li>Should havae a user detail component that shows the details for the user selected in the user list.</li>
                <li>The details component should be a reactive form and keep the data model separate from the form model.</li>
                <li>The user's name in the form should be read only.</li>
                <li>The nickName should be editable.  It is required as well.</li>
                <li>The nickName field should display styling feedback to the user to let them know the field is required</li>
                <li>The optIn should be a checkbox.  It must be selected as true for the form to be valid. </li>
                <li>The should be a revert button that will cancel the changes the user has made before clicking update and revert to the data model values. </li>
                <li>When the form is submitted it should update the data model programmatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
