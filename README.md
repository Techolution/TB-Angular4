# Techolution Bootcamp: Angular 4
Techolution Bootcamp Labs For Angular 4
## Requirements
- An IDE that will work with typescript.  It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Nodejs.  You should use the LTS version: https://nodejs.org/en/
- angular-cli. Install: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Techolution/TB-Angular4.git`
2. install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start: `npm start`
4. Open up: localhost:4200 in a browser to verify things are working.

## Labs
Each lab has its own branch.  When starting a new lab you will run the git command to checkout the branch for the lab.  For example, if you are going to start lab2, you would run:

```
git checkout lab2
```

You should then add/commit any code changes that you make to this branch before moving to the next lab. 
If you are not very familiar with git this is how you can commit your code: 

```
git add .
git commit -m 'my special commit message'
```

Each lab also has a solution which exists in a branch by the same name but with '-solution' added to it.  For example, the solution for lab2 could be checked out like this: 

```
git checkout lab2-solution
```

Make sure that you commit all of your code in the lab you are working on before checking out the solution!  ( you may also discard the changes if you know how to do so).
