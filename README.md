## Labs
This git repo contains a serious of tags.  While doing the labs you will pointing to different tags for each lab using the `git reset --hard lab_name` command. If you have come to a place where your code is so messed up that you need to start over you may simple run the command again.  Optionally, you may see the solution ( or a possible solution ) to the challenge by running `git reset --hard lab_name_solution`.  

It is important to know that you do not need to add or commit any code although if you want to do so locally as you work on each lab you may do so ( this may be helpful for some labs ).  Each time you re-run the `git reset` command by starting a new lab or moving to a solution, however, you will lose all of your code and
